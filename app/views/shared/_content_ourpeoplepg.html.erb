              <div class="paragraph_content">Open Heavens Christian centre is able to function largely due to the selfless commitment of over 300 people, who give their time to run the various parishes and ministries during the week and those that take place over each weekend. Popularly referred to as the church's 'workforce', the activities of these volunteers are coordinated by a leadership structure made up of pastors, deacons, ministers and elders, in addition to heads of various ministries.</div>

                <div><b>Pastoral Council</b></div>
                Spiritual oversight and direction is provided by a core group of leaders - supported by the other leadership strands - who have submitted themselves in the service of the church, its congregation and its local community. These leaders have come from different walks of life - including medicine, law, IT and marketing - and have lent the wealth of their experience to the organisation's growth.
